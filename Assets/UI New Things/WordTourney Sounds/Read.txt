This will be used in a video, which I must send to make, 
but if whoever makes the animations can create the explanatory video with this audio it would be great to move forward faster.

This video will be used the first time the user enters the tournament section, it should also have a Skip option in case they want to skip it.
The video should display something like the spin does and it should be in a nice frame.

We must first finish all of the above, before getting here, since the tutorial will show a video of how the system works and must be viewed with the finished application.
